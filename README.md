Tactic is an opensource CMS which also offers Asset Management and Workflow Management Tools. http://tacticopensource.com/

We use Tactic at ICE Animations [www.iceanimations.com] to manage our production pipeline and store and retrieve our assets and libraries. 

This library is still a work in progress, which attempts at wrapping the vfx project template of the tactic client library into objects. This may help us unify our production logics into a single library for use accross platforms. and hopefully deliver a platform delivering a more robust CGI pipeline.
